# 100DaysofCode-Fatal-Force-Analysis
Day 100 of the 100 Days of Code Course

This is the last project of the 100 Days of Code course. The goal of this project was to analyze fatalities where police used force.  The project built on the concepts covered during the data science portion of the course as well as day 99 of the course. It felt like this day's project was a bit easier to work with data compared to day 99.

Within this repo are the notebook that was created along with the five CSVs used for the project
- Deaths_by_Police_US
- Median_Household_income_2015
- Pct_Over_25_completed_HighSchool
- Pct_People_Below_Poverty_Level
- Share_of_Race_By_City
